# macOS on Apple Silicon KVM

An experimental, working macOS ARM64 virtual machine for Apple Silicon Macs
running Asahi Linux. The guest runs with KVM acceleration in QEMU's `vmapple`
machine and displays through [Reims](https://github.com/steelbrain-bot/reims-vgpu)
and Vulkan.

This is research code, not a polished virtual-machine product. It patches the
Asahi kernel, QEMU, and Reims to bridge assumptions that normally only hold
when `vmapple` runs under Apple's Hypervisor.framework.

## M1 Max / M1 Ultra, Fedora 44: headless ephemeral runners

On M1 Max (t6001) and M1 Ultra (t6002) hosts running Fedora Asahi Remix 44,
this tree boots **macOS 13.6 Ventura and macOS 26.4 Tahoe** under KVM to SSH
in about 10–20 s, with no host window, desktop session or GDB. Each job runs
in a throwaway reflink clone of a read-only golden bundle. Technical findings,
failures and measurements are summarised in [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md).
Differences from the M2 Pro flow below:

| Layer | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Host kernel | Stock Fedora Asahi `kernel-16k` plus the two KVM patches in `patches/linux-7.1.13-*` (Apple PAuth VM-key context, in-KVM emulation of the no-syndrome GIC store). `scripts/build-host-kernel.sh` builds them into an RPM from the host's own base SRPM. |
| QEMU | `scripts/build-qemu.sh` builds aquarat/reims-vgpu and its `vendor/qemu` (aquarat/qemu-reims-vgpu: upstream QEMU + steelbrain's vmapple/Reims branch + KVM, BDIF sizes, PAC HVC x0, headless polling, the `avp,rtc` clock, `gfx-device=none`). No patch files. `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` merges upstream into both forks. |
| Renderer | `VK_DRIVER_FILES=…/lvp_icd.aarch64.json` (llvmpipe). Mesa's Asahi compiler asserts on Reims FP16 shaders. |
| macOS 26 provisioning | Restore with macosvm forcing the version-1 hardware model (`patches/macosvm-hwmodel-override.patch`, `MACOSVM_HWMODEL_B64`). Create the account from a KVM single-user boot over the serial console (`scripts/serial-shell.py`), because the Data volume is keystore-encrypted. |

Day-to-day use on the host:

```sh
scripts/vm-job.sh 'sw_vers; xcodebuild -version'            # one throwaway guest
GOLDEN=~/vm-artifacts/tahoe-26.4-25E246-v7 CPUS=8 RAM=16G scripts/vm-job.sh …
scripts/bake-golden.sh <src> <dst> "<note>" '<provisioning command>'
scripts/bake-xcode.sh <src> <dst> Xcode_*.xip [--ios-platform]

# CI: one ephemeral runner registration and one throwaway guest per job
set -a; . hosts/<host>.env; set +a
FORGEJO_URL=https://forgejo.example FORGEJO_TOKEN=… FORGEJO_SCOPE=repos/<owner>/<repo> \
    scripts/forgejo-ephemeral-runner.sh "$VM_SLOTS"     # runs-on: macos-26-arm64
GH_TOKEN=… GH_SCOPE=repos/<owner>/<repo> scripts/gha-ephemeral-runner.sh "$VM_SLOTS"
```

`systemd/vmapple-{forgejo,gha}-runner.service` run the same orchestrators as
services through `scripts/runner-service.sh`; edit `User=` and the checkout
paths before installing them.

The golden image `tahoe-26.4-25E246-v7` used in these examples (baked under
the `avp,rtc` QEMU, so NVRAM holds an RTC offset) contains the GitHub Actions
runner 2.338.0, forgejo-runner 13.2.0 (cross-compiled for darwin-arm64),
Node 24 LTS, the Command Line Tools for Xcode 26.6, and a DHCP service on an
optional second NIC. Golden images are built locally and never published.
[docs/IMAGES.md](docs/IMAGES.md) is the step-by-step recipe for building the image chain from an Apple restore image (`images/` holds one script per layer).

Host portability: `scripts/build-host-kernel.sh <base.src.rpm> <buildid>
[extra patches]` builds the host kernel from whatever Fedora Asahi kernel a
machine runs. `hosts/<host>.env` holds per-machine sizing and settings; copy
`hosts/example.env.example` to start one. On hosts with wired LAN,
`sudo scripts/host-net-setup.sh taps br0 <slots>` plus `NET_TAP_PREFIX=vmtap`
gives each slot its own DHCP address on the LAN, with a stable MAC per slot.

Known issue: about 4–5 % of macOS 26 boots stall in early userspace and never
reach SSH (down from 10–15 % before the `avp,rtc` clock and the v7 image).
`vm-job.sh` and `bake-golden.sh` retry automatically from a fresh clone. The
remaining stall has an idle guest with drained virtio queues; see
[docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md). `GFX=none` boots without the paravirtual GPU
(no Metal) for jobs that don't need it.

`vm-job.sh` and `gha-ephemeral-runner.sh` use `set -uo pipefail` without
`-e` on purpose: they must capture a failing job's status and still shut the
guest down and clean up.

## What works

The known-good configuration boots macOS Ventura 13.6 (22G120) to the normal
graphical Setup Assistant on an M2 Pro host running Fedora Asahi Remix:

- KVM acceleration with eight active guest CPUs
- normal `launchd`, `WindowServer`, and `loginwindow` userspace
- `AppleParavirtGPU` and `AppleParavirtDisplay`
- a live 1920x1080 Reims/Vulkan window
- persistent serial and QMP logs
- user-mode networking with optional SSH forwarding on `localhost:2222`

Rendering was verified with Mesa llvmpipe because the experimental host kernel
used for the successful run did not include the Asahi DRM driver. A summary
of the investigation, including failed approaches, is in
[docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md).

## Why patches are needed

| Layer | Problem | What this repository changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux KVM | Apple's pointer-authentication VM key, `APCTL`, and `KERNKEY` state is not part of the normal ARM KVM context | Saves/restores the Apple registers and exposes them through KVM's one-register API |
| QEMU `vmapple` | The machine was built around TCG/HVF assumptions | Enables KVM, wires the GIC/PMU timers, forwards Apple's private PAuth HVC service to QEMU, implements that service, and pins PSCI to 1.1 for Ventura |
| XNU handoff | KVM cannot emulate one pre-indexed GIC MMIO store because the stage-2 abort lacks a valid instruction syndrome | The launcher pauses at handoff and uses GDB to rewrite that exact instruction sequence in guest RAM; the guest disk is not modified |
| Reims | Linux guest-memory mapping and llvmpipe capability reporting differed from the macOS host path | Adds direct mappings for contiguous QEMU RAM and avoids the native-FP16 shader path on CPU Vulkan devices |

The relevant files are:

- [`patches/linux-6.19-vmapple-pac-vmkey.patch`](patches/linux-6.19-vmapple-pac-vmkey.patch)
- [`patches/reims-qemu-linux-arm64.patch`](patches/reims-qemu-linux-arm64.patch)
- [`patches/reims-rust-linux-arm64.patch`](patches/reims-rust-linux-arm64.patch)
- [`scripts/inject-xnu-kvm.gdb`](scripts/inject-xnu-kvm.gdb)

[`patches/vmapple-usb-chardev.patch`](patches/vmapple-usb-chardev.patch) and
the USB/IP scripts belong to the separate Linux restore experiment. They are
not needed when starting with a VM provisioned on macOS.

## Requirements

- an Apple Silicon Mac running Asahi Linux with `/dev/kvm` available
- a matching Fedora/Asahi 16 KiB kernel source tree
- the kernel patch in this repository, built and booted as a separate kernel
- GDB, Git, a C toolchain, Cargo, Ninja, GTK 3 development files, and Vulkan
  development files
- temporary access to macOS for Apple firmware and VM provisioning
- roughly 20 GiB for an Apple restore image, 64 GiB apparent space for the
  sparse guest disk, and several GiB for builds

The proven host was Fedora 42 on an M2 Pro with kernel
`6.19.14-vmapple2`. Other SoCs, distributions, kernels, and macOS releases are
interesting experiments, not verified configurations.

## 1. Obtain AVPBooter from macOS

`AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin` is supplied by macOS as part of
Virtualization.framework. On a Mac, copy it out with:

```sh
cp /System/Library/Frameworks/Virtualization.framework/Resources/AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin .
shasum -a 256 AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin
```

Move it to the Asahi host and keep it under the ignored `artifacts/` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p artifacts/firmware
mv /path/to/AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin artifacts/firmware/
```

The successful run used `mBoot-18000.121.3` (304,352 bytes, SHA-256
`513ca3fbb2cd5accb0a6da96a5e476d593ebae403d7edb33aebca88f505dac61`).
Do not publish this file: it is Apple-provided firmware and is intentionally
excluded by `.gitignore`.

## 2. Provision the guest on macOS

Install [macosvm](https://github.com/s-u/macosvm), clone this repository on the
macOS machine, and supply a legitimately obtained UniversalMac restore IPSW:

```sh
brew install macosvm
IPSW=/path/to/UniversalMac_13.6_22G120_Restore.ipsw \
  scripts/provision-on-macos.sh
```

The script creates this private bundle:

```text
artifacts/guest/
├── aux.img
├── aux.img.trimmed
├── disk.img
└── vm.json
```

Copy the bundle to the same location on the Asahi host. Preserve the sparse
disk while copying; for example, use `rsync --sparse`. `vm.json` contains the
VM's machine identity, and the images contain an installed copy of macOS, so
none of these files should be committed or shared.

The known Ventura IPSW is
`UniversalMac_13.6_22G120_Restore.ipsw`, SHA-1
`a1675f2c8412122a5e796981571b0269a966708e`. Apple firmware and restore-version
compatibility can change; start with the verified versions before trying a
newer combination.

## 3. Build and boot the patched Asahi kernel

Apply the kernel patch after preparing the matching Fedora Asahi
`6.19.14-400.asahi.fc42` source tree:

```sh
patch -d /path/to/linux-tree -p1 \
  < patches/linux-6.19-vmapple-pac-vmkey.patch
```

Use the installed 16 KiB kernel configuration, build `Image`, `modules`,
`vmlinuz.efi`, and `dtbs`, then install the result alongside the stock kernel
with a distinct `LOCALVERSION` such as `-vmapple2`. Keep the stock kernel as
the default and select the experiment for one boot first.

This patch is tied to that kernel revision; do not apply it blindly to
another release. For Fedora Asahi 7.1.x kernels use
`scripts/build-host-kernel.sh`, which applies the `patches/linux-7.1.13-*`
patches to the host's own base SRPM.

After booting the patched kernel:

```sh
uname -r
test -r /dev/kvm && test -w /dev/kvm
```

## 4. Build the patched Reims/QEMU

Clone the pinned Reims revision next to this repository and initialize its QEMU
submodule:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/steelbrain-bot/reims-vgpu.git ../reims-vgpu
git -C ../reims-vgpu checkout 2844274c34baa1043d37995f5b1a9f1d265eae03
git -C ../reims-vgpu submodule update --init vendor/qemu
git -C ../reims-vgpu/vendor/qemu rev-parse HEAD
# expected: e17ddb98f71df5697daf2f830587f672a8f4f5a7

CONFIRM=1 scripts/build-gui-qemu.sh
```

The build script verifies both revisions, copies the source under ignored
`build/`, applies the QEMU and Reims patches, and produces:

```text
build/reims-linux-product/vendor/qemu/build/qemu-system-aarch64
```

Verify the complete host side:

```sh
scripts/check-host.sh
```

## 5. Launch macOS

With the firmware and guest bundle in place:

```sh
AVPBOOTER="$PWD/artifacts/firmware/AVPBooter.vmapple2.bin" \
GUEST_DIR="$PWD/artifacts/guest" \
  scripts/launch-gui-kvm.sh
```

QEMU starts paused. The wrapper injects verbose boot arguments, applies the
verified XNU GIC instruction correction, detaches GDB, and leaves QEMU in the
foreground. Press Ctrl-C to stop it cleanly. Serial and QMP logs are written
under ignored `logs/`.

Useful overrides:

```sh
CPUS=4 RAM=8G ...                 # guest resources
SSH_PORT=2223 ...                 # host-side SSH forwarding
CONSOLE=gtk ...                   # also show QEMU's fallback GTK console
CONSOLE=none ...                  # suppress every fallback console
XNU_BOOT_ARGS='-v serial=11 debug=0x14c' ...
```

The normal display path is the native Reims window, so the default QEMU display
is `none`. `scripts/launch-kvm.sh` is the lower-level launcher when the GDB
handoff wrapper is not wanted.

## Linux restore experiment

The repository also contains an unfinished attempt to provision directly from
Asahi Linux. `scripts/launch-dfu.sh` exposes AVPBooter's virtual DFU device,
`scripts/vmapple-usbip.py` bridges it to Linux `vhci-hcd`, and
`scripts/probe-vmapple-usb.py` exercises the transport. The work reached real
DFU transfers but did not produce the known-good guest used above. See
[docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md) before continuing that path.

## Project boundaries

- Never commit firmware, IPSWs, restore images, VM disks, VM identities, or
  logs. The repository ignore rules cover the expected locations and formats.
- This project does not redistribute macOS or bypass Apple's restore signing.
- Kernel and hypervisor experiments can crash or reboot the host. Keep a stock
  kernel boot entry and backups of anything important.
- There is no support promise. Reproduction reports with exact host, kernel,
  QEMU, firmware, and guest versions are welcome.
