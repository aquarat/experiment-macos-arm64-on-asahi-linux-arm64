# Licensing

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or
(at your option) any later version (`GPL-2.0-or-later`); the full text is in
[LICENSE](LICENSE). The exceptions below are files that are not this
project's own work, or that patch other projects.

## Work by the original author (not licensed)

This repository started as a fork of
[steelbrain/experiment-macOS-arm64-on-asahi-linux-arm64](https://github.com/steelbrain/experiment-macOS-arm64-on-asahi-linux-arm64)
by Anees Iqbal (steelbrain). That repository has no licence, so his work
remains his, all rights reserved. It is included here as published upstream,
with credit, and this project grants no licence to it.

His work is in these files, taken unchanged from the bootstrap commit
(`657bb24`):

- `scripts/apple_device_tree.py`
- `scripts/extract-ecid.py`
- `scripts/inject-xnu-kvm.sh`
- `scripts/launch-dfu.sh`
- `scripts/probe-vmapple-usb.py`
- `scripts/provision-on-macos.sh`
- `scripts/restore-info.sh`
- `scripts/vmapple-usbip.py`
- `patches/linux-6.19-vmapple-pac-vmkey.patch`
- `patches/reims-qemu-linux-arm64.patch`
- `patches/reims-rust-linux-arm64.patch`
- `patches/vmapple-usb-chardev.patch`

These files contain his work together with later changes made in this
project. Only the later changes are under `GPL-2.0-or-later`:

- `scripts/build-gui-qemu.sh`
- `scripts/check-host.sh`
- `scripts/inject-xnu-kvm.gdb`
- `scripts/launch-gui-kvm.sh`
- `scripts/launch-kvm.sh`
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`

Most of these belong to the legacy bring-up flow
([docs/LEGACY-BRINGUP.md](docs/LEGACY-BRINGUP.md)). The current flow still
uses `scripts/launch-kvm.sh`, `scripts/extract-ecid.py` (called by
`launch-kvm.sh`) and `scripts/provision-on-macos.sh` (the restore step of
`images/host/macos-restore.sh`). If the original author asks, his work will be
rewritten or removed.

## Patches to other projects

A patch is a change to another project, so it is offered under that
project's licence:

| Patch | Licence |
| --- | --- |
| `patches/linux-7.1.13-*.patch` | GPL-2.0 (Linux) |
| `patches/qemu-*.patch` | GPL-2.0-or-later (QEMU) |
| `patches/mesa/*.patch` | MIT (Mesa) |
| `patches/macosvm-hwmodel-override.patch` | macosvm's licence |

## Dependencies

The QEMU and Reims changes live in their own forks, each under its
upstream's licence:

(GPL-2.0-or-later),
[aquarat/reims-vgpu](https://github.com/aquarat/reims-vgpu) and
[aquarat/metal2vulkan](https://github.com/aquarat/metal2vulkan) (LGPL-3.0).
This project does not include or redistribute macOS, Apple firmware or Xcode.
